# Parkinson-Disease
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. It is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain, leading to a range of motor and non-motor symptoms. 

Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to allow for timely intervention and to slow the progression of the disease.
However, accurate diagnosis of PD in the early stages is challenging, particularly when differentiating it from other conditions with similar symptoms, such as SWEDD (Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit). Current diagnostic methods such as imaging techniques and clinical assessments have limited accuracy in the early stages of the disease
